          Contactless cards and mobile wallets make it feel like “just tap and go”. This page explains what really happens in that moment: how NFC is used, how your card data is protected, when limits apply and how the issuer decides whether to approve the transaction.

      <h2>What Is Tap-to-Pay on a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>Tap-to-pay is a contactless way to use your credit card or digital wallet at a payment terminal. Instead of inserting or swiping the card, you hold it close to the reader so the chip can communicate wirelessly using NFC (near-field communication).</p>
      <p>From the merchant’s point of view, the transaction still runs across the same card networks. The difference lies in how the card details are transmitted and how the issuer authenticates you, often using additional checks behind the scenes rather than a PIN or signature at the terminal.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How a Tap Payment Moves Through the System</h2>
      <p>When you tap your card or device, the terminal and card chip establish a very short-range NFC connection. The card or wallet sends a limited set of data, including a dynamic cryptogram or token, rather than simply broadcasting the full card number in plain text.</p>
      <p>The terminal packages this information and sends an authorization request through the acquirer, network and issuer. The issuer checks that the token or cryptogram is valid, verifies your available credit and risk profile, and then approves or declines the transaction in real time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Fees and When PINs Are Required</h2>
      <p>Many regions have contactless limits, where small transactions can be tapped without entering a PIN, while larger purchases still require a stronger form of cardholder verification. Issuers may also enforce their own internal limits based on your risk profile and recent activity.</p>
      <p>Tap-to-pay itself does not usually add extra fees compared to chip-and-PIN, but the same interchange, FX and merchant fees apply. What can change is how frequently the issuer asks for additional verification, especially if you perform many consecutive contactless transactions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Tap-to-Pay with Mobile Wallets</h2>
      <p>When you load a card into a mobile wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay, the device stores a tokenized version of your card rather than the actual card number. Each tap generates a unique, one-time code that can only be used for that specific transaction.</p>
      <p>Biometric checks such as fingerprint or face recognition act as strong customer authentication before the card token is released. This can reduce the need for PIN-based checks at the terminal and can change how often you are asked to verify higher-value payments.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Security, Risk Controls and Lost Cards</h2>
      <p>Modern contactless systems are designed to limit the risk of “skimming” or accidental taps. The short range of NFC, dynamic cryptograms and per-transaction limits all reduce the amount of damage that can be done if a card is briefly misused.</p>
      <p>If your card or phone is lost, the issuer can immediately block the physical card and remotely disable the wallet token. Monitoring tools, automatic risk scoring and real-time alerts help issuers spot unusual tap patterns and intervene quickly.</p>
